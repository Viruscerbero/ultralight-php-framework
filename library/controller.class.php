**  The base controller is a simple abstract class that defines the structure of all controllers.
**
**  The job of a controller is to handle data that the user inputs or submits, and update the Model accordingly.
**  The Controllerâ€™s life blood is the user; without user interactions, the Controller has no purpose.
**  The Controller is the only part of the pattern the user should be interacting with.
**  The Controller never gives data to the View. The controller doesn't interact with the View at all.
**  The Controller can be summed up simply as a collector of information, which then passes it on to the Model
**  and does not contain any logic other than that needed to collect the input.
**  The Controller is also connected to a single View and to a single Model, making it a one way data flow system, 
**  with handshakes and signoffs at each point of data exchange.
**  Less controller code means more reusable code.
